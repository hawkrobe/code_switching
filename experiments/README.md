Pilot 1.0:

* Included in CogSci paper
* Used a fully within-subjects design (i.e. every participant did both own group & other group)

Pilot 2.0:

* Added graphical elements to instructions & transitions to emphasize how the networks were structured
* Switched to a between-subjects design (i.e. every participant only gets assigned to 'own' or 'other' not both)
* Added a control condition (i.e. also produce for set of unseen tangrams, which we don't expect to have a group effect)

Pilot 2.1:

* Switched the UI of the post-test to more closely resemble the UI of the main experiment (to prevent context effect)
* Tweaked post-test instructions a little bit to clarify
