          <p>

          <h5 className="bp3-heading">INTRODUCTION</h5>
          <p>
            Thank you for deciding to volunteer in this research project.
            This research is being conducted by Robert Hawkins, a postdoctoral
            research fellow, Irina Liu, an undergraduate student, and Tom Griffiths, a faculty member,
            at Princeton University. This study takes approximately 30 minutes to complete, but will
            vary depending on how long you must wait for other participants to join.

            Your participation in this research is voluntary. You are free to refuse to take part,
            and you may stop taking part at any time. You are free to discontinue participation
            in this study at any time with no penalty. Below is a description of the research project, and your
            consent to participate. Read this information carefully. If you
            agree to participate, click "I agree" to indicate that you have read
            and understood the information provided on this consent form.

          <h5 className="bp3-heading">PROCEDURES</h5>
          <p>
            If you agree to take part in the research, you will play a series of communication games
            with other participants: one of you will describe a picture for the other to choose out of
            a lineup of other pictures. All of the information we obtain during the research will be
            kept confidential, and not associated with your name in any way. However, while the study
            is running it will be associated with your MTurk worker id. Once the study is complete
            we will replace your worker id with a random string.

          <h5 className="bp3-heading">CONFIDENTIALITY</h5>

            need to keep secret specific information that is general public
            knowledge or that you legally receive from another source that is
            not affiliated with Microsoft so long as that source was entitled to
            share the information with you and did not obligate you to keep it a
            secret. You agree not to disclose to Microsoft any non-public
            information, whether yours or a third partyâ€™s without notifying
            Microsoft in advance.
          </p>
